[MI-DXL Editor](MI-DSL/)
This xText editor is exploited by CGS4Adaptation Approach to generate DXL library for SysML BDD and requirements diagram to be installed in the DOORS database

[CGS4Adaptation Approach](CGS4Adaptation/)
This approach combines two types of models, GRL and SysML models to support self-adaptive SCPSs in their development process and in their run-time adaptation activities when expected and unexpected changes are encountered. This part support easy to manage traceability between GRL and SysML models
