# Traceability Support Files
Contain four parts:


## 1- Report Generation Velocity Template [SmartHome.txt](SmartHome.txt)
This is the report generation template that reads block definition and requirements diagrams in SysML model created by Cameo Systems Modeler. 
We implemented this template to create a DSL descriptions that can be imported by DOORS using DXL library. Chapters 6 and 8 in the thesis explain the results of executing this template by Cameo Systems Modeler. 

## 3- MI-DSL Classes [MI-DSL-classes.txt](MI_DSL_Classes.txt):
We used MI-DSL language to define SysML classes. These classes descripe the SysML models and used to create the DXL Library to import SysML models in DOORS tool. This is introduced in Section 5.1.1 in the thesis.

## 3- [DXL Library](https://github.com/andaamal/ThesisArtifacts/tree/master/Traceability/DXL%20Library%20for%20SysML%20Model)
## 4- [Models](Models/README.md)
