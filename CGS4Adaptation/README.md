# Traceability Support Files
Contain four parts:


## 1- Report Generation Velocity Template [VTLTemplate.txt](SmartHome.txt)
This is the report generation template that reads block definition and requirements diagrams in SysML model created by Cameo Systems Modeler. 
We implemented this template to create a DSL descriptions that can be imported by DOORS using DXL library.    

## 3- MI-DSL Classes [MI-DSL-classes.txt](MI_DSL_Classes.txt):
We used MI-DSL language to define SysML classes. These classes descripe the SysML models and used to create the DXL Library to import SysML models in DOORS tool. 

## 3- [DXL Library](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Traceability/tree/main/CGS4Adaptation/DXL%20Library%20for%20SysML%20Model)
This includes the DXL library generated by the xText editor for one time using the MI-DSL classes. xText editor generates the DXL library automatically via Xtend transformations.

## 4- [Smart Home's Models](Models/README.md)
This contains all smart home case study models including GRL, features and SysML
