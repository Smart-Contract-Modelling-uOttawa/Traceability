# GRL Models:
This Folder includes all the GRL models of the smart home case study. We create a GRL model for SHMS according to the Smart Home case study description and the requirements from [SmartTeam](https://smart-researchteam.github.io/). The model is divided into several diagrams, shown in the following reports issued by [jUCMNav tool](https://github.com/JUCMNAV/projetseg-update/wiki).

 In GRL, actors (dashed ellipses) contain intentional elements, which are mainly goals (rounded-corner rectangles), softgoals (clouds), and tasks (hexagons), together with indicators (hexagons with two lines at the top and bottom). AND/OR/XOR decomposition links are labeled accordingly, contributions are arrows annotated with a numerical positive/negative weight, and dependencies are shown with the filled `D' links.
