# MI-DXL Folder
Includes all the files of the Xtext-based Model Import Domain Specific Language(MI-DSL) editor for the Eclipse environment. This editor creates DXL libraries based on the description provided in the form of MT-DSL classes. You can down load and install the project as a plugin in Eclipse IDE.  The compact version of the editor is provided in the MI-DXL.rar archive.
# How to install
Please follow the instructions below.

## Requirements
- Eclipse Modeling Tools [download]( https://www.eclipse.org/) 
- Download the latest Xtext plugin [Instructions](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html)

## Instructions
- Clone or download  the master branch of the repository.
- Open Eclipse
- Use `File` > `Open Projets from File System`
- to select the directory, go to the \MI-DXL\MTDSL_Workspace 
- Import each of these three cloned directories into the Eclipse workspace as shown in the following figure.  

1- `org.xtext.dsl.dxl` 
2- `org.xtext.dsl.dxl.tests`
3- `org.xtext.dsl.dxl.ui`

- Then, press `Finish`.

# How to use
- In the `Package Explorer` panel, right click on the `org.xtext.dsl.dxl` directory, then click on `Run as` > `Eclipse Application`
- In the new opened Eclipse window create a new project ![alt text](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Traceability/blob/main/MI-DSL/images/Screenshot%202023-01-21%2016.48.08.png).
- If you create a java project, please do not open the java perspective.

- 
- right click on the `scr` directory inside this project and create a new file with `.dxldsl` extension. ![alt text](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Traceability/blob/main/MI-DSL/images/Screenshot%202023-01-21%2016.50.22.png)

- Click finish. You will get the following screen asking you if you want to convert `your project` to xText project. select `yes`
- ![alt text](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Traceability/blob/main/MI-DSL/images/Screenshot%202023-01-21%2016.50.59.png)
- right click on the new file 'HelloWorld.dxldsl' and select 'Open with' -->'DxlDsl editor'
- ![alt text](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Traceability/blob/main/MI-DSL/images/Screenshot%202023-01-21%2016.51.15.png)
- Now you can write your classes. you can copy the classes in [HelloWorld.dxldsl](HelloWorld.dxldsl) and past them in your dxldsl file to test the tool.
- once you press 'Ctrl+s' to save the file, the DXL library corresponding to your classes will be created and saved in new diarectories, named 'scr-gen/output' as shown in the following image.

# How to import the model in DOORS database. [Tutorial Folder](Tutorial/)
The generated DXL library should be installed in the DOORS directory, `<path to DOORS>\lib\dxl\addins` folder. The generated DXL script ([the report generated by the Report Wizard using VTL template](https://github.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Traceability/tree/main/CGS4Adaptation)) is then run in Rational DOORS to import the descriped model. The DXL library for SysML is invoked by the first line in the script, and the model will be imported inside DOORS database.
The tutorial shows how to create classes and create the corresponding DXL library. Also, guidelines to write the correct DXL description is supplied in [Report(XinyuZhao)](Tutorial/Report(XinyuZhao).pdf) including the related models and results.
